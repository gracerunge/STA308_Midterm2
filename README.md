# STA308_Midterm2

Purpose: To write write script which 
   answers the required questions
   for STA 308 Fall 2023 second midterm. 
  
Scenario: As a basketball coach at the end of a game, you get to decide:  
   does your team go for a two point field goal or a three 
   point field goal? Your code must consider both scenarios.
   
This code runs simulations of how many points will be scored 
  in both scenarios based on given success/failure 
  probabilities of making a pass, making the shot, and/or getting fouled. 
  
  For each scenario, I approximate the mean number 
  of points scored and the standard deviation, and use this information
  to approximate the probabilities that we win the game, if the game 
  will head into overtime, or we will lose the game.
  Which strategy is preferred under these assumptions?
